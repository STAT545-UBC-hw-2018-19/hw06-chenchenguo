Introduction
------------

[Homework 06](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw06/hw06.html): Data wrangling wrap up

Goals:
------

The first assignment of STAT 547M, complete two of the six topics.

Part 1: Character data
----------------------

Requirements
------------

Work the exercises in the Strings chapter or R for data science.

Implementation
--------------

Strings charpter

Firstly load all needed packages

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(stringr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(broom))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(MASS))
```

14.2.5 Exercises
----------------

### 1. Whats the difference between paste() and paste0()? What the equivalent stringr functions of them?

``` r
(name_sports <- paste("Bas", "ket", "ball"))
```

    ## [1] "Bas ket ball"

``` r
(name_sports1 <- paste0("Bas", "ket", "ball"))
```

    ## [1] "Basketball"

``` r
# The difference between paste() and paste0() is the argument sep by default is " " for paste() and "" for paste0()

# paste0() is equivalent to str_c
(name_sports2 <- str_c("Bas", "ket", "ball"))
```

    ## [1] "Basketball"

``` r
# paste() is equivalent to str_c(.., sep = " ")
(name_sports3 <- str_c("Bas", "ket", "ball", sep = " "))
```

    ## [1] "Bas ket ball"

### 2. Describe the difference between sep and collapse arguments to str\_C()?

``` r
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
y <- c("w", "x", "y", "z")
paste(x, y, sep="%%")
```

    ## [1] "a%%w" "b%%x" "c%%y" "d%%z"

``` r
paste(x, y, collapse="%%")
```

    ## [1] "a w%%b x%%c y%%d z"

``` r
paste(x, y, sep="%%", collapse=",")
```

    ## [1] "a%%w,b%%x,c%%y,d%%z"

``` r
paste(x, y, sep=",", collapse="%%")
```

    ## [1] "a,w%%b,x%%c,y%%d,z"

``` r
# Hence, the sep defines what separates the entries in those tuple-wise concatenations
# the collapse will return any concatenated pairs as part of a sigle length-1 character vector
```

### 3. Use str\_lennth() and str\_sub() to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of length?

``` r
vec_str <- "asdfghj"
vec_length <- str_length(vec_str)
str_sub(vec_str,(vec_length+1)/2, (vec_length+1)/2)
```

    ## [1] "f"

``` r
vec_str1 <- "asdfgh"
vec1_length <- str_length(vec_str1)
str_sub(vec_str1,(vec1_length)/2, (vec1_length)/2+1)
```

    ## [1] "df"

### 4. What does str\_wrap() do?

``` r
txt <- c("Jane can run quickly.  So can Dick.",
         "",
         "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog.")
writeLines(strwrap(txt, width = 25))
```

    ## Jane can run quickly.
    ## So can Dick.
    ## 
    ## The quick red fox jumped
    ## over the lazy brown dog.

``` r
writeLines(strwrap(txt, width = 30, indent=5))
```

    ##      Jane can run quickly.
    ## So can Dick.
    ## 
    ##      The quick red fox jumped
    ## over the lazy brown dog.

``` r
# strwrap can print strings into paragraphs
```

### 5. What does str\_trim() do?

``` r
vec_5 <- c("hi", "hello", "Richard Jeffeson")
vec_5
```

    ## [1] "hi"               "hello"            "Richard Jeffeson"

``` r
strtrim(vec_5, 7)
```

    ## [1] "hi"      "hello"   "Richard"

### 6. Write a function that turns a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c.

``` r
vector_to_string <- function(v){
    if(length(v)==0){
        stop("NA")
    }
    if(length(v)==1){
        return(v)
    }
    str1 <- str_c(v[1:length(v)-1], collapse = ", ")
    str2 <- str_c(str1, v[length(v)], sep = ", and ")
}
vec_6 <- c("s","o","s")
(vector_to_string(vec_6))
```

    ## [1] "s, o, and s"
